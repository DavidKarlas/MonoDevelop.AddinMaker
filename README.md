This MonoDevelop addin makes it easy to create and maintain MonoDevelop addins.

To build and install from source, simply run `Install.bat` (Windows) or `Install.sh` (Mac, Linux).

To build against a specific version, you can provide arguments, e.g.

  ./Install.sh /p:MDBinDir=../monodevelop/main/build/bin /p:MDProfileVersion=6.0
